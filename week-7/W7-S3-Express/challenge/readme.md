# Full Stack Notes Application using Node and Express

## Challenge

Now that you have learned how to:

- Create a REST API to handle server HTTP requests
- Serve web pages statically using Express

It's time to build your first **full-stack application**!

### Your challenge:

Build a **Note-Taking Application** that allows users to:

- **Create** new notes
- **Read** existing notes
- **Update** notes
- **Delete** notes

Once complete, you should **deploy** your application on **Render.com** and provide the following for submission:

1. A link to your **GitHub repository**
2. A link to your **deployed application** on Render

## Key Learnings

- How to **build** a full-stack application using **Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
- How to **deploy** a Node.js application on **Render.com**.
- How to structure a **README.md** file for documentation.

## User Story

As a user,  
I want to create, edit, and delete notes,  
So that I can keep track of my thoughts and tasks efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Set up an **Express server** that serves both API endpoints and static frontend files.
- [ ] Create a **frontend UI** that allows users to add, view, edit, and delete notes.
- [ ] Implement **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for notes.
- [ ] Store notes **persistently** (e.g., using a JSON file or a database).
- [ ] Deploy the application on **Render.com**.
- [ ] Submit both the **GitHub repo link** and the **deployed Render link**.

## Getting Started

### **Set Up the Project**

1. **Initialize a new Node.js project**:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

2. Install Express:

â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js
/server.js (Main Express backend)
/data.json (Storage for notes)

4. Build your application following the examples and exercises from this week

5. Deploy to Render

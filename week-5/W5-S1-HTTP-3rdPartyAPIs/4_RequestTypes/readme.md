# Types of HTTP Requests

## Challenge

In this exercise, you will explore the different methods of creating HTTP requests in JavaScript. Modern web pages commonly use `fetch` or `axios`, but many sites still use `jQuery` and `XMLHttpRequest (XHR)`. Your goal is to run different examples and use `console.log` to identify and comment on the differences between them.

## Key Learnings

- Understanding common and legacy methods of making HTTP requests in JavaScript.
- Comparing `fetch`, `axios`, `jQuery.ajax`, and `XMLHttpRequest (XHR)`.
- Identifying the differences in syntax, response handling, and error management.
- Recognizing the best use cases for each approach.

## User Story

As a developer,  
I want to understand different ways to make HTTP requests,  
So that I can choose the right approach depending on the projectâ€™s needs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Create examples of HTTP requests using the following methods:
  - `fetch`
  - `axios`
  - `jQuery.ajax`
  - `XMLHttpRequest (XHR)`
- Use `console.log` to inspect and compare:
  - Response structure
  - Error handling
  - Code complexity and readability
- Add comments explaining:
  - How each method works
  - The pros and cons of each approach
- Document findings in a markdown file or comments within the code.
- Bonus: Create a simple web page where users can trigger these requests and see results in the console.

## Getting Started

1. Include jQuery in your project (CDN or local file).
2. Write code for each HTTP request method.
3. Open the browser console and analyze the output.
4. Comment your observations in the code.

## Summary

Compare your results and reflect on:

- Which method is easiest to use?
- Which method provides the best error handling?
- What would you use for a modern web app?
- Where might legacy methods still be useful?

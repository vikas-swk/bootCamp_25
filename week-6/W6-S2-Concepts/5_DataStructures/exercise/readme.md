# Python Data Structures

## Challenge

In this challenge, you will explore the use of Python's built-in data structures: **lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries**. You will analyse example code that demonstrates their usage, run the code using debugging tools, and observe how each structure behaves.

After understanding their differences, you will be given **five real-world use cases** and will need to determine which data structure is best suited for each task.

## Key Learnings

- The differences between **lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries**
- When to use each data structure in real-world applications
- How to analyze and debug Python code to understand data structures

## User Story

**As a** Python developer,  
**I want to** understand how different data structures work,  
**So that** I can choose the best one for a given problem.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Run and examine example code that demonstrates lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
- Use debugging tools (e.g., print statements, breakpoints) to observe how the data structures function.
- Correctly determine which data structure is best suited for **five real-world use cases**.
- Explain **why** each chosen structure is the best fit for the given problem.

## Suggested Steps

1. Review the example Python code provided in `data_structures.py`.
2. Run the code and use debugging tools to analyze the output.
3. Research or recall the properties of lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
4. Read the five real-world use cases provided.
5. Match each use case with the most appropriate data structure and justify your choice.

## Example Real-World Use Cases

1. **Storing a collection of unique usernames in a system.**

2️. **Keeping track of multiple values for a single entity, such as a student's name, age, and grades.**

3️. **Maintaining an ordered list of tasks for a to-do list app.**

4️. **Storing geographical coordinates that should not change.**

5. **Keeping a record of items where each item must have a unique identifier and associated information.**

✏️ **Your task:** For each case, determine which data structure is best suited and explain why!

# Processing Numbers in Python Using NumPy

## Challenge

Python is particularly well suited for **processing numerical data**, and the `NumPy` library provides powerful tools for handling arrays and performing mathematical operations efficiently.

In this exercise, you will work with `main.py`, which contains **six examples** demonstrating how NumPy can be used to process an array of numbers. These examples include:

- **Creating an Array**
- **Basic Math Operations**
- **Generating Random Numbers**
- **Finding Even Numbers in an Array**

Follow the **TODO prompts** in `main.py` to complete the challenge.

If you want a more **advanced challenge**, try completing `advanced.py`, which contains more complex NumPy operations.

ðŸ’¡ **Good luck!** ðŸš€

## Key Learnings

- How to **install third-party libraries** in Python
- Understanding **basic NumPy operations** and their applications
- Performing efficient mathematical and array operations with NumPy

## User Story

As a developer,  
I want to process numerical data efficiently using NumPy,  
So that I can perform complex mathematical operations with ease.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Install the `numpy` library using `pip install numpy`.
- Complete all **TODO tasks** in `main.py`:
  - Create a **NumPy array** from a list of numbers.
  - Perform **basic mathematical operations** (addition, multiplication, etc.).
  - Generate an array of **random numbers** using NumPy.
  - Extract all **even numbers** from a given array.
- If attempting `advanced.py`, complete additional **complex operations**, such as matrix manipulation and statistical functions.

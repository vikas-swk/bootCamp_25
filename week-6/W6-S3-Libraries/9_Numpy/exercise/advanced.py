"""
Modify the existing code to create a 3x3 matrix and perform the following operations:
	1.	Find the determinant of the matrix.
	2.	Find the inverse of the matrix (if it exists).
	3.	Find the row-wise and column-wise mean of the matrix.
    
Explanation
	•	Determinant helps in understanding whether a matrix is invertible.
	•	Inverse is useful in solving linear equations.
	•	Row-wise and column-wise mean are important for data analysis and normalization.

Challenge for Students
	•	Modify the code to generate a random 3x3 matrix instead of defining it manually.
	•	Try computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors using np.linalg.eig(matrix).
